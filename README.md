# IRIS Species

The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The dataset consists of 150 entries of data about iris plants. There are exactly 50 of each type of iris described in the data. The data points for each flower are:

1] SepalLengthCm

2] SepalWidthCm

3] PetalLengthCm

4] PetalWidthCm

5] Species

# Objective of this project

In total we have 4 variables (1 to 4) that have an influence on which species of plant a given plant might be. In machine learning terms these variables are called features. The final variable (5) is called a label, and it is the label/species that we would like to predict.

That is to find the species of Iris flower based on this dimensions.
